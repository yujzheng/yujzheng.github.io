## Current Research

### Human-AI Interaction and Trust
My current research focuses on understanding how people develop trust in AI systems and how this trust affects their decision-making processes. I investigate the factors that influence human perception of AI reliability, transparency, and explainability.

**Key Questions:**
- How do users form mental models of AI systems?
- What factors contribute to appropriate trust calibration in human-AI teams?
- How can we design AI interfaces that support effective collaboration?

### Cognitive Processes in Technology Interaction
Building on my background in cognitive psychology, I explore how fundamental cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and perception are affected by interaction with intelligent systems.

**Current Projects:**
- Attention allocation in human-AI collaborative tasks
- Memory formation and retrieval in AI-assisted learning environments
- Perceptual biases in AI-generated content evaluation

## Research Methods

I employ a variety of research methods to investigate human-AI interaction:

- **Experimental Psychology**: Controlled laboratory experiments to test specific hypotheses about human cognition and behavior
- **User Studies**: In-depth studies of how people interact with AI systems in realistic contexts
- **Eye-tracking and Physiological Measures**: Objective measures of attention, cognitive load, and emotional responses
- **Qualitative Research**: Interviews and observational studies to understand user experiences and mental models
- **Computational Modeling**: Developing models to predict and explain human behavior in AI contexts

## Collaborations

I actively collaborate with researchers in:
- Computer Science and AI
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Cognitive Science
- Design and User Experience

## Future Directions

Looking forward, I am interested in expanding my research to include:
- Cross-cultural differences in AI perception and trust
- Ethical considerations in human-AI interaction design
- Applications in educational technology and learning systems
- Long-term effects of AI interaction on human cognition
