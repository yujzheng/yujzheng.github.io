    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Yujie Zheng is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Tongji University, with research interests in human-computer interaction and visual cognition.
During her doctoral studies, she focused on the mechanisms of visual search and pursued innovations in both theoretical and methodological approaches. She proposed a time-based serial-parallel model of visual search and developed a multiple-target search paradigm. Her related work has been published in international journals such as Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, and Attention, Perception & Psychophysics.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At present, she continues to focus on the intersection of cognitive science and interactive technology, aiming to translate theories of visual cognition into applications for human-computer interaction, thereby contributing to both academic and practical advancements in the field.
